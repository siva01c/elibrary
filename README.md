# Simple Symfony Library

This project is a simple book library. Books can be imported from `datasources/books.json`. Books stored in the database can be exported and saved. Only an admin can perform import/export operations. The project includes only basic administration and supports a single role: `ROLE_ADMIN`.

By default, the website should be accessible at:
ðŸ‘‰ [https://elibrary.ddev.site/](https://elibrary.ddev.site/)
(*This assumes the project folder name hasn't been changed.*)

The DDEV project includes **MariaDB** (available at `127.0.0.1:32826`) and **Adminer** (accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)).
The database username and password are both `"db"`.

### ðŸ‘¤ Create a New Administrator User

1. **Enter the container shell**:

   ```bash
   ddev ssh
   ```

2. **Navigate to the app folder**:

   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Prepare migration**:

   ```bash
   bin/console doctrine:migrations:diff
   ```

   This command will create a migration object in the `app/migrations` folder.

5. **Create the database schema**:

   ```bash
   bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
   ```

   This will create database tables according to the migration object created in the previous step.

6. **Create an admin user**:

   ```bash
   bin/console app:create-user test@test.test ROLE_ADMIN password
   ```

   * Replace `test@test.test` with the desired email address.
   * `ROLE_ADMIN` is the user role.
   * `"password"` is the user password.

Now you can log in and add, edit, delete, or import new books from JSON.
